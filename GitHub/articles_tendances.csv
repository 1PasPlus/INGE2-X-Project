""It was just so quick. They had no warning whatsoever.





""The pilot saved our lives. We're alive, so that's all that matters in the end.""



Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 hit ""sudden extreme turbulence"" over Myanmar about 10 hours into its journey on Tuesday, abruptly rising and plunging several times.





The plane, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew, made an emergency landing at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, where medical staff used gurneys to ferry the injured to ambulances waiting on the tarmac.



A 73-year-old British man died, while Bangkok's Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital said late on Tuesday that 71 people had been sent for treatment — six of them seriously injured.





The airport in the Thai capital said 83 passengers and crew were hurt.





There were 56 Australians on board — the largest group — of which eight were hospitalised.





Goh Choon Phong, the CEO of Singapore Airlines, expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to the family of the deceased in a video message on Wednesday.

'Crazy flight': SQ321 passengers recount onboard horror

The flight from London bound for Singapore fell into an air pocket while cabin crew were serving breakfast before it encountered turbulence, prompting the pilots to request an emergency landing, Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn told a press conference.





Photos from inside the plane show the cabin in chaos, strewn with food, drinks bottles and luggage, and with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling.





Andrew Davies, a British passenger aboard the Boeing 777-300ER, told BBC radio that the plane ""suddenly dropped"" and there was ""very little warning"".





""During the few seconds of the plane dropping, there was an awful screaming and what sounded like a thud,"" he said, adding that he helped a woman who was ""screaming in agony"" with a ""gash on her head"".





Separately, he told a BBC podcast he feared the plane was going to crash.





""Remembering the plane now — the huge dents in the roof that people had obviously hit with their head. There was a water bottle stuck in a gap in the ceiling,"" he said.

Allison Barker told the BBC her son Josh, who was aboard the plane, texted her that he was on ""a crazy flight"" that was making an emergency landing.





""It was terrifying,"" she said. ""I didn't know what was going on. We didn't know whether he'd survived, it was so nerve-racking. It was the longest two hours of my life.""





Another passenger said some people's heads had slammed into the lights above the seats and punctured the panels.





""I saw people from across the aisle going completely horizontal, hitting the ceiling and landing back down in like really awkward positions. People, like, getting massive gashes in the head, concussions,"" Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student who was on the flight, told the Reuters news agency.





Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said her thoughts were with those affected by the incident.





""The Australian government will provide consular assistance wherever we can, wherever it's needed to those people,"" O'Neil told Seven's Sunrise program on Wednesday.

How safe are Singapore Airlines flights?

Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognised as one of the world's leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.





Its last accident resulting in casualties was a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles via Taipei, where it crashed on 31 October 2000 into construction equipment at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after attempting to take off from the wrong runway.





The crash killed 83 of the 179 people on board.





Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network.





Boeing said it was in touch with Singapore Airlines and was ready to provide support.

Stranded Australians are becoming frustrated as they await information about more repatriation flights. More than 100 Australians and other tourists were evacuated last night.

More than 100 Australians and other tourists were evacuated last night. What's next? A French government assisted flight is expected to carry about 100 Australians to Brisbane later today.

Stranded Australian tourists in riot-stricken New Caledonia are still unsure when they will be evacuated, despite French authorities offering seats on departure flights to some travellers.

The Australian government evacuated 84 Australians and 24 foreign nationals from New Caledonia's capital Noumea yesterday on military transport planes.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said a French government-assisted flight landed in Brisbane late on Wednesday carrying 103 Australians and their families.

As Australians continue to make it home, some the ABC spoke to said they had been notified of French government flights, but it was not clear what time they would depart.

Tylah Carre, an Australian tourist in Noumea, said he received a text from French authorities saying they would ""conduct flights for [their] safe departure"".

""But we don't know if we have six hours or just an hour, like yesterday when people were told there's a bus downstairs,"" Mr Carre said.

""Many are staying in their rooms in case they get the call.""

'We lost hope'

Janine Banks, another Australian tourist, said she was frustrated with the communication from the Australian government.

She said she hadn't received any information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade until about 9pm last night and relied on WhatsApp for updates from other tourists.

""We were told Monday night to be ready for evacuation on Tuesday, so we packed and waited by the phone all day.""

She then heard no updates during the day.

""We lost hope after the 6pm curfew,"" Ms Banks said.

Ms Banks had initially booked a trip to Vanuatu but her flight plans changed when Air Vanuatu went bust.

Queensland academic Nicole George was teaching in Noumea when rioting erupted last week.

She was hoping to be one of the more than 100 Australian residents who were repatriated on the two ADF flights overnight.

""Yesterday was a hard day because we were thinking we might get home,"" Ms George said.

Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said the French government was ""currently planning flights to Brisbane today, using their resources"".

""So the primary plan is more French flights,"" he said.

""But we do have contingency plans and we do have planes on stand-by should there be an issue with that course of action.""

He added a French plane was due to leave for Brisbane this afternoon or evening and evacuate about 100 Australians.

""So bringing it to around 184 Australians roughly, brought home over the last day or two.""

Kid-free holiday goes awry

Victorian doctor Max Winchester and wife Tiffany are also stranded and said their first attempt at a kid-free holiday had gone terribly wrong.

The pair, from Woodend, had been holidaying when the political unrest began and were unable to get seats on the first evacuation flights.

""We're being told we're going to be evacuated by the French and we just don't feel comfortable with that,"" Dr Winchester said.

""We've seen what a mess this place is and the French haven't been able to manage that, and we just don't feel comfortable with putting our security in the hands of the French at the moment.

""It was my attempt at our first child-free romantic holiday.""

Dr Winchester said he and his wife had run out of their medication and were unable to go to the nearest town because of fires, looting and vandalism.

""It's not safe to go into town. Basically we spend every night here with one eye open, hoping we don't get attacked by looters and rioters,"" Dr Winchester said.

Yesterday's defence force flights departed from new Caledonia's domestic airport, but Australian tourists told the ABC they were unsure if barricades still blocked the road to New Caledonia's international airport further north.

From his hotel window, Mr Carre couldn't see any fires but heard local news of a factory ablaze in Noumea's industrial zone.

""It feels like it has de-escalated, but it's uneasy,"" he said.

Some shops had stock, but most shelves were still empty.

New Caledonia's business chamber reported 150 companies had been looted and burned.

French president to visit New Caledonia

French President Emmanuel Macron is on his way to New Caledonia in a move which could also complicate further evacuation flights.

Aides to Mr Macron said he would meet with officials and local representatives on Thursday for a day of talks focused on politics and on the reconstruction of the island.

The unrest in New Caledonia, with a population of about 270,000, was sparked by French plans to impose new rules that would give tens of thousands of non-Indigenous residents voting rights.

Pro-independence groups say any such move would dilute the Indigenous Kanak vote.

Ms George said she was worried Mr Macron's visit would further inflame tensions and make it difficult to continue evacuations.

""We don't think a group of tourists from Australia are really high priority at the moment.

""We are concerned if the violence kicks off [again] in the next couple of days.""

She said there was a lot of uncertainty among the remaining Australians.

""We are trying to band together, we have a WhatsApp group here, we're trying to support each other.""";new, caledonia, stranded, australian, still;static/images/image_trend_1.png
