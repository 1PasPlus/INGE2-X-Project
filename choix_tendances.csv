As Donald Trump approaches his $464m bond payment deadline on Monday, social media users have come together to coin yet another nickname for the former president: “Don Poorleone.”

The meme uses an image of the iconic Marlon Brando character, Vito Corleone, from “The Godfather“ and adapts his famous line.

While Vito Corleone vowed to “make him an offer he can’t refuse”, the Trump meme states: “I made an offer everyone refused.”

The hashtag also inspired posts about other members of the Trump family.

“#DonPoorleone and his #FamilyFullOfFredos,” one X user wrote, including a photo of Mr Trump and his two sons, Eric and Don Jr, and referring to wayward son Fredo Corleone from the Godfather movies.

On Monday, the former president must post a $464m bond payment to comply with a New York civil court ruling that found him guilty of fraud earlier this year. New York State Judge Arthur Engoron also found that Mr Trump’s adult sons were liable for fraud alongside their father.

The same ruling barred Mr Trump from doing business in the state for three years. The money owed is the sum of what the president must forfeit as “ill-gotten gains” and interest that has accrued since.

If he does not pay by the 25 March deadline, New York Attorney General Letitia James has said that her office will ask the court to seize Mr Trump’s assets.

Mr Trump’s legal team told the court last week he did not have the funds to post bond. Mr Trump faces “insurmountable difficulties” securing the bond, according to his attorneys.

Trump Tower might be seized: What do New Yorkers think?

The former president approached “about 30 surety companies through four separate brokers” to no avail this month.

On Sunday political show, “Inside with Jen Psaki,” the lawyer and commentator Neal Katyal referenced the meme while discussing Mr Trump’s financial woes.

“There is a reason why I think some people are calling Donald Trump ‘Don Poorleone’ right now, and it’s because he’s kind of talking out of both sides of his mouth,” Mr Katyal said.

Despite Mr Trump’s attorneys telling the judge that he doesn’t have the money, the former president said on Friday that he has “almost five hundred million dollars in cash.”

“His lawyers say he can’t get the money in time, he’s getting on Truth Social — his social media platform — and saying he can,” Mr Katyal continued.

“You know, these things don’t make much sense together. It’s a microcosm of what got Trump in trouble in the first place: Lying about his assets. And now he’s kind of doing the same thing.”

Mr Trump has also reached out to his supporters, asking for donations in an email blast, and warned that he could lose his properties. This inspired yet more social media posts. “Revenge is a dish I can no longer afford without your patriotic cash gift. #DonPoorleone,” wrote one person on Twitter/X.

The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment."

A spring snowstorm battered the state starting on Sunday and continuing overnight. While the accumulating snow is done for now, many spots will see some rain on Monday, and more powder is on the way later on.

WEATHER RESOURCES: More weather coverage | Animated radars | School Closings & Delays

Much of the state is still under a winter storm warning, though it's expired in the Twin Cities and southeastern Minnesota. A NEXT Weather Alert remains in place.

Snow totals

At Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, 8.2 inches of snow were measured, which is a record, according to the National Weather Service. Most of the metro landed in the 6- to 10-inch range.

In the west metro, Minnetonka and Corcoran each got about 7 inches. Down in southern Minnesota, Wabasha saw the same.

Over the border in Wisconsin, snow totals were even more impressive. Menomonie recorded 9 inches, while Eau Claire got a record 10 inches.

Parts of northern Minnesota, such as Brainerd and Duluth, received about 4-5 inches, according to National Weather Service reports.

Much of the snow accumulated overnight as it began to fall more heavily. By 7 p.m. Sunday, only 3 inches had been registered at MSP Airport, according to the NWS.

NEXT Weather Meteorologist Adam Del Rosso said anyone measuring Monday morning may see depressed totals because of how wet this snow is.

""A lot of the snow actually is compacting, so if you go measure this morning, you might not see that much because there's a lot of slush, too,"" Del Rosso said."

Preliminary autopsy finds Riley Strain’s death 'accidental' with no foul play suspected;New York Post;https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzI1L3VzLW5ld3MvcHJlbGltaW5hcnktYXV0b3BzeS1maW5kcy1yaWxleS1zdHJhaW5zLWRlYXRoLWFjY2lkZW50YWwv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjUvdXMtbmV3cy9wcmVsaW1pbmFyeS1hdXRvcHN5LWZpbmRzLXJpbGV5LXN0cmFpbnMtZGVhdGgtYWNjaWRlbnRhbC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en;Mon, 25 Mar 2024 11:46:03 GMT;Preliminary autopsy finds Riley Strain’s death 'accidental' with no foul play suspected  New York Post Riley Strain found in Nashville: Missing college student timeline  TennesseanRiley Strain’s body found in Cumberland River  WKRN News 2Riley Strain's Death Was 'Accidental,' Police Say  PEOPLEMayor suggests barriers along Cumberland riverbank after Riley Strain's body recovered  WSMV 4;University of Missouri student Riley Strain’s death was “accidental,” with no indications of foul play, according to a preliminary autopsy after the body of the 22-year-old was discovered in a Nashville river.;"University of Missouri student Riley Strain’s death was “accidental,” according to a preliminary autopsy after the body of the 22-year-old was discovered in a Nashville river.

Toxicology results and a final autopsy report are still pending, but there is no apparent foul play, Metropolitan Nashville police spokesperson Kris Mumford told The Tennessean.

A “detective attended the autopsy examination” — and the death “continues to appear accidental,” Mumford said.

Strain, who went missing earlier this month after being kicked out of a Nashville bar on a trip with fraternity brothers, was found dead Friday in the Cumberland River in West Nashville.

“I just ask that you mommas out there hug your babies tight tonight, please,” Riley’s mother, Michelle Whiteid, told reporters. “Please for me, hug your babies tight tonight.”

The student was visiting Music City with his Delta Chi fraternity brothers when he vanished after leaving country star Luke Bryan’s honky-tonk bar, Luke’s 32 Bridge, on March 8.

His family initially suggested he had been overserved, but the bar’s operators said he had only consumed one alcoholic beverage and two drinks of water at the watering hole.

The bar shared that security decided to kick Strain from the nightspot based on their “conduct standards” due to his behavior.

Strain was apparently captured on video crossing Gay Street after leaving the bar — about a 17-minute walk from Luke’s 32 Bridge, police said.

A homeless man claimed he saw a “very, very intoxicated” Strain almost fall over the edge of a trail into the river.

Strain’s fraternity spoke glowingly of their departed brother.

“The Delta Chi Fraternity is deeply saddened by the tragic passing of our esteemed fraternity brother, Riley Strain,” it told The Post in a statement.

“Our hearts go out to Riley’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time as we work to provide support and resources to all those affected by this tragedy.”

VoicesMountain Lion Attack Leaves Man Dead and Brother Injured in California  The New York TimesMountain lion attack kills 21-year-old man, injures younger brother in California  Fox News;A 21-year-old was killed and an 18-year-old injured when the pair, who are brothers, were attacked by a mountain lion in Georgetown, Calif., on Saturday, authorities said.;"A teenager called 911 from a remote area in California on Saturday to report a rare incident: He and his brother had been attacked by a mountain lion. The 18-year-old and his 21-year-old brother were separated during the attack. When officials arrived to the scene in Georgetown, Calif., an area about 50 miles east of Sacramento, they said they found the 21-year-old lying on the ground, the mountain lion crouched beside him.

The older brother was killed in Saturday’s attack, authorities said — the first recorded fatal human-mountain lion incident in California in 20 years.

According to the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, the mountain lion was euthanized near the scene within a few hours.

Officials had not publicly identified the brothers as of Sunday evening, but said the 18-year-old underwent multiple surgeries and would probably make a full recovery. His family “is grateful for the prayers and condolences from the community [but] wishes for privacy in order to process this tragic event,” the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release Sunday.

The state wildlife department on Sunday evening confirmed that DNA from the scene of the attack matched the mountain lion that was euthanized. It was a 90-pound animal in healthy condition, the department said.

While it’s not unusual for mountain lions to roam around the same trails humans use, they tend to stay away from people, said Winston Vickers, a wildlife research veterinarian at the University of California at Davis.

Because attacks are so rare, it is hard to pinpoint risk factors, but research has found that attacks and resulting death are more likely if a child is present or if individuals are moving erratically, he said.

“There’s kind of a little bit of everything when you look at the statistics,” Vickers said.

On Saturday around 1 p.m., the younger brother called 911 to report the attack, the sheriff’s department said. The brothers had been antler shed hunting in the area.

When police and paramedics arrived, they found the teenager, who suffered “traumatic injuries to his face,” according to the sheriff’s department, and began to provide aid. They also started a search for the 21-year-old brother.

After spotting him around 1:45 p.m., deputies fired their weapons to scare the animal off and clear the area to give aid, but the 21-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the sheriff’s department.

Saturday’s incident is the first recorded fatal mountain lion attack against a human since January 2004, according to data from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

In the 2004 incident, a 35-year-old man was killed in the Whiting Ranch Regional Park in Orange County. Since then, there have been 12 nonfatal mountain lion attacks verified by the state wildlife department. The last recorded attack was in September 2022.

The latest attack is one of 22 total verified incidents since March 1986 — four of them, including Saturday’s, were fatal, the state wildlife department data shows.

Mountain lions are a specially protected species under California law. The animals are “typically solitary and elusive,” the wildlife department said.

While the agency reviews hundreds of sightings annually, attacks on humans by mountain lions are rare. A person is 1,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by a mountain lion, according to the department.

People spending time outdoors should stay aware while on trails and be as prepared as they can be, Vickers said. He said bear spray or waving a walking stick can be effective to defend oneself."
