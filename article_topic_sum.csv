Bitcoin began Monday trading above $65,000 for the first time in more than a week. It's since retraced slightly, but is still 0.5% higher than it was this time yesterday.

And what's been good for Bitcoin has been great for the rest of the crypto market. Early Monday morning the global cryptocurrency market capitalization is sitting at $2.5 trillion after having gained 1.3% in the past day, according to CoinGecko data.

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has backtracked to $64,264.08, which is still 3% higher than it was this time last week. In the past day, $13 billion worth of BTC has been traded. Roughly 22% of that volume was traded on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume.

On Binance, it's the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin that's been the most popular trading pair for BTC investors, according to CoinGecko data. FDUSD, launched by Hong Kong based company First Digital Labs in 2023, has accounted for $3 billion worth of volume in the past day.

The world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization also just celebrated a birthday of sorts. The Bitcoin network has now processed more than 1 billion transactions.

Bitcoin daily transactions spiked to an all-time high this time last year, when the BRC-20 standard and ordinals soared in popularity—but not without creating a bit of controversy. A vocal group of developers at the time said that BRC-20 tokens and ordinals should be blocked on the network.

But now a newcomer, Runes, has become the main driver behind growing daily transactions. Just yesterday, the Bitcoin network saw 304,306 Runes transactions, 193,439 ""good old BTC"" transactions, and about 4,000 of Ordinals and BRC-20 transactions combined, according to a Dune dashboard. That means Runes made up roughly 60% of all transactions on the network yesterday.

Runes is a protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It's been described as a project that picks up where BRC-20 tokens, which effectively introduced NFT-like assets to the network. Runes is an attempt to make the process of creating fungible tokens on Bitcoin more efficient and has ushered in a new era of shitcoins for the crypto OG.

There have been a few other noteworthy Bitcoin developments over the weekend.

An old #Bitcoin wallet from 2011 just moved $44 Million worth of BTC. The owner of the wallet hodled all the way from $2 to $65000. What a legend! pic.twitter.com/tqKt6hxcWj — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 6, 2024

For starters, a 13-year-old wallet that's held 687 Bitcoin since it was trading for $2 has just moved their stash. It was highlighted by Bitgrow founder Vivek Sen on Twitter earlier this morning.

It's hard to say why an anonymous whale wallet that was created more than a decade ago moved its funds, but traders tend to take it as a heartening sign when someone who could have sold at any time held onto their BTC for so long.

But one thing that Bitcoin [BTC] the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap has shown, is that choosing";"Holders of Bitcoin might accumulate more, prompting suggestions of a price increase.

A crucial indicator revealed that BTC might plunge again before it hits another all-time high.

Investing in crypto can be risky. But one thing that Bitcoin [BTC], the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, has shown, is that choosing the coin can yield rewards that only a few assets can dream of.

But don’t take AMBCrypto’s word as advice.

Instead, a quick look at BTC’s all-time performance revealed that this is no fluke. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s price has increased by a mind-blogging 103,942,579% since its inception.

However, one thing investors can assure you is that it is not just glitz and glamour on Bitcoin’s end.

For instance, the market crash of 2022 was proof that “up only” is only a myth, as any Bitcoin investment can go down once the market hits a bear phase.

Watch out! The direction is not always north

In 2021, Bitcoin hit an All-Time high (ATH) of $69,000. But a year back, triggered by certain events, the coin dropped below $16,000, confirming that the asset’s volatility could have an unpleasant impact on investors.

Fast-forward to 2024, the coin surpassed its all-time high, reaching $73,750 on the 14th of March. Despite the hike, the coin retraced. As of this writing, it changed hands at $64,298.

This value represented a 5.58% decrease in the last 30 days. But is Bitcoin a good investment for you? Well, certain factors influence the price of the coin.

For instance, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year influenced the rally to its new all-time high. However, the amazing inflows of the first quarter are nowhere to be found.

As such, investors are left with the fundamentals and key indicators to depend on. For starters, AMBCrypto looked at Bitcoin’s potential to give good returns using on-chain metrics.

More gains may be coming

One of the metrics we looked at was the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio shows the profitability of BTC holders.

At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 1.1.9%. This means that if holders of Bitcoin sell their assets, the average return would be around this percentage.

But this is unlikely to happen, as the unrealized gains do not seem enticing enough to trigger a widespread sell-off. Therefore, the reasonable action would be for investors to hold to their coins.

Also, when the MVRV ratio was 21.30%, Bitcoin’s price was over $71,000. With this data, more accumulation could take place, and this could lead BTC back to a more profitable region.

Will Bitcoin add an extra 40% increase?

Furthermore, there have been predictions that the coin might hit $100,000 this cycle. While some argue in favor of the forecast, others prefer to be on the conservative side.

For the bullish ones, the ETF and ATH before halving was evidence that Bitcoin might add another 40% to its price before it hit the top.

AMBCrypto spoke to Ben Cousens about the matter. Cousens is the Chief Strategy Officer at ZBD, a company using the Bitcoin lightning network to power payments.

While the ZBD chief did not give a specific price prediction, he displayed optimism in his comment, saying that,

“Within the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, historically, the halving has coincided with rising fiat prices due to the supply shock. his halving came at a time when ETFs were increasing institutional adoption, playing a bigger role with more of an impact. The additional excitement about the halving leads to a new cohort of users who learn how to use Bitcoin.”

Going by Cousens’s opinion, a new wave of new investors might come for Bitcoin. Should this be the case, rising demand could lead to higher prices, and most investments might be worth it.

A short-term outlook may not cut it

However, short-term investors might need to be wary. As much as BTC can be a good investment, the price might also undergo a correction.

One of the reasons for this is the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio. This metric looks at a coin’s market cap relative to its total trading volume.

If the NVT ratio increases, it means that the coin could be overvalued in the short term. However, a low NVT ratio suggests an undervaluation of the current asset value.

At the time of writing, IntoTheBlock data showed that Bitcoin’s NVT ratio had risen to 98.79, implying that a return below $64,000 could be imminent.

Should this be the case, the price of Bitcoin might collapse to $59,000 again. But in the long run, Bitcoin can be a good investment depending on the purchase price.

For this cycle, the price of the coin is expected to hit between $87,000 and $92,000. Therefore, buying at press time price or waiting for another decline might be a good move.

The move marks a major milestone for GBTC, which has seen $17.46 billion in withdrawals since it converted from a trust to an easily tradable ETF in January, due to the higher fees it charges compared with rivals.

Some outflows were also tied to the wave of bankruptcies in the crypto industry, as companies that collapsed in the last two years pulled money out of the fund to repay their creditors.

GBTC saw inflows of $63 million on Friday, according to investment management firm Farside Investors. It has $18.08 billion in assets under management (AUM), according to its website.

But its position as the biggest spot bitcoin ETF by AUM has come under threat from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which manages $16.91 billion, according to its website.

Grayscale said in March that it would seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to spin off a portion of GBTC's assets into a new, lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust. However, the company has yet to determine the fees the Mini Trust will charge.

Story Highlights Analyst Rekt Capital sees a buying opportunity in Bitcoin's recent dip.

There's a possibility the cycle is accelerating due to wider adoption.

Rekt Capital suggests looking at prior all-time highs to predict a timeframe (280-350 days).

Combining both methods suggests a peak between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025.

In the whirlwind of Bitcoin’s market ups and downs, one voice stands out, urging action: it’s time to buy. Analyst Rekt Capital recently shed light on the patterns shaping Bitcoin’s cycles.

But wait. Let’s back up a little. Why the bullish prediction? Is this the right move for your portfolio? Only one way to find out. Dive in!

Understanding the Patterns

Getting to the heart of the matter, Rekt Capital asks the question on everyone’s mind: when will the Bitcoin bull market peak, and how long will it last? Drawing from historical data, Rekt Capital predicts a peak around 518 to 546 days after the halving event, suggesting we could see it around mid-September or mid-October.

This timeline syncs with the traditional rhythm of Bitcoin’s market cycles, guided by halving events. Following this beat, Rekt Capital advises buying after a 20% drop and before the rebound. With the dip now exceeding 20%, the opportunity to buy Bitcoin strengthens, with losses expected to stabilize around 24%.

Chances of Speeding Up?

However, another perspective to consider is the possibility of an accelerated cycle. This theory suggests that market cycles may be shortening due to increased adoption, institutional interest, and other factors. If this accelerated cycle hypothesis holds, the bull market peak could arrive sooner than expected.

Rekt Capital suggests using prior all-time highs to predict the peak. They highlight that Bitcoin’s bull market top occurs 266-315 days after reaching all-time highs. This method provides a new perspective on Bitcoin’s trajectory, especially given its current rapid cycle.

In addition, Rekt Capital examines Bitcoin’s history after breaking old highs, showing a trend of spending longer before the bull market tops. These findings extend the peak range to 280-350 days beyond old all-time highs.

Putting the Pieces Together

Bringing these threads together, Rekt Capital suggests that Bitcoin’s bull market high could land between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025. Yet, amidst this forecast, the analyst advises blending traditional and innovative perspectives to navigate Bitcoin’s unpredictable path.

Apart from BTC, most of the crypto projects faced regulatory uncertainty.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF approval in January continues to elicit mixed feelings about whether it “legitimizes crypto.”

In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Neel Maitra, a former SEC crypto specialist, said that the January approval was “grudging” and doesn’t look great for the market.

Part of his speech stated,

“Its (approval) was grudging, and it was just for Bitcoin, and it’s not good news for the crypto generally.”

To support his arguments, Maitra mentioned the SEC’s rejection of spot BTC ETFs in the past seven years before the courts forced its hand.

Additionally, the agency emphasized that the approval was limited to BTC and shouldn’t be read as a general crypto approval.

Divergent views on Bitcoin ETF impact

However, Franklin Bi, a general partner at Pantera Capital, had a contrarian take. In an interview with “The Block,” the exec claimed that the U.S. spot BTC ETFs approval “validated crypto.”

He further commented,

“The approval has really shown people that directionally speaking, regulation is still moving in a positive direction for digital assets.”

The executive added that the approval also convinced many institutional investors that crypto is a long-term technology trend worth exploring.

True to Bi’s word, U.S. spot BTC ETFs have seen massive interest from institutional players.

For instance, the leading world asset manager, BlackRock, had an impressive BTC ETF debut and is eyeing the tokenization of real-world assets on the blockchain.

However, regulatory heat in the industry still exists. Despite the approvals, the SEC has filed lawsuits against Uniswap [UNI] and Consensys’ MetaMask.

Additionally, the agency has not clearly stated whether Ethereum [ETH] is not a security. This prompted Consensys to sue the SEC and seek clarity from the courts on the status of ETH.

In a separate development, a new class action lawsuit against Coinbase claims that the exchange misled investors into buying “securities” like Solana [SOL], Near [NEAR], and UNI, amongst others.

That said, BTC had regulatory clarity after the January ETF approvals. However, several crypto projects and tokens like ETH face regulatory uncertainty.
